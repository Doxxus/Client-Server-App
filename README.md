# Client-Server-App
 A small client-server proof of concept written in C# in Visual Studio 2019
 
 Depends on the Newtonsoft.Json library (.dll is included)
 
 Executables are found in the /executables folder
 To run the application:
  Run the ServerApp.exe in (/executables/Server) first
  Then run the ClientApp.exe in (/executables/Client) next.
 
 To change the storage configuration simply open the ServerApp.exe.config file and change the 'storage_type' app setting to either 'database' or 'file' 
 depending on which method you want to use.
